**_NB! Project is in development phase, so if you see that something is missing - just give it some time to come!_**

    This project contains scripts for creation an example database (MySQL 8 syntax used) for training advanced SQL skills (aggregations, window functions, ranking, working with time/date, strings etc.). It will be filled up with exercises and solutions gradually. 
If you have an idea of interesting exercises or riddles to solve you are welcome to commit the tasks.         

    History behind: Long story short, one day I needed to brush up my SQL skills for a job interview. With help of AI I've created simple database for training and finally decided to publish my exercises as it could be helpful for anyone else.
